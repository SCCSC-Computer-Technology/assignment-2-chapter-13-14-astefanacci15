It may have been beneficial to have the purpose of each LINQ query commented so that I knew their purpose at a glance. I believe tool tips would have been helpful on the main form. The design of the form had a pleasing asthetic. I like that all of the error messages were specific and informative to their respective error instances so the user is aware of where exactly they created an error.
The find by product description function did not return any data no matter what I input. I believe the error is on line 84, when the code checked to see if user input was empty you have it checking the text from the product number text box instead of the product description text box. So it causes the program to automatically throws an error like the input box is empty.
Our codes differ in that this coder chose to display the specified data in a list box. Whereas I displayed the data that met search criteria in a product grid view so the biggest difference is that my display choice allowed the user to see all related information to the record that met the criteria.
