Code Review for astefanacci:

Code Compilation and Warnings:
- The code appears to be free of syntax errors, compiling successfully without any issues.
- There are no compiler warnings.

Readability and Documentation:
- Overall, the code demonstrates good readability, supported by informative comments describing different sections.
- Descriptive variable and method names contribute to the clarity of the code.
- Additional comments clarifying the purpose of specific logic blocks or complex operations would enhance overall documentation.

Code Improvement:
- A suggested improvement is to create a dedicated method for clearing the list box, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Repetitive Code and Dead Code:
- I see repetition in clearing the result list box, it is recommended to abstract this functionality into a separate method.
- I see no instances of dead code

Software Defects and Testing:
- The code itself seems free of specific defects, however the biggest flaw I noticed was when results box seems to only be able to display a product when the product number is entered.
- Other attempted entries do not appear in the results box when requested. A posible user error, but something that was noticed.

Exception Handling:
- Basic exception handling is in place with the use of well descriptive error messages. 

Appropriateness of Framework and Code Usage:
- The use of Windows Forms and LINQ appears fitting for the context of a straightforward data retrieval and display application.

Differences in Approach:
- The author employs a direct approach to manage user input for different scenarios.
- However, this was a different approach than mine in that the Product table was directly imported onto the form.
- Personally, I favor this authors approach, but I found my method was more accurate to the assignment instructions.

Constructive Feedback:
- Overall, a very well written program with clear comments and little to no defects.
- Breaking down the code into smaller methods would enhance overall code readability.
- Consider abstracting repetitive code into reusable methods to promote code maintainability and reduce redundancy.
