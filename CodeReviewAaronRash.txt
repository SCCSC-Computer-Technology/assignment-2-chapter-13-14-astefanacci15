(This is for attempt 2)

for your ProductDescription button, it checks the text box for the product NUM, instead of the product Description.

for the More Than/Less Than button, it checks the MIN/MAX radio button.

and for the MIN/MAX button, it checks for More Than/Less Than radio buttons.

If we fix the mix ups, the program runs smoothly.

Some additional help that goes a long way, is to use ".Contains" instead of  "==" for searching the description/number. It effectively is a LIKE query.

For example:
where Product.Description.Contains(productDescription)

instead of:
where Product.Description == productDescription

I also like the colors. Much more interesting than my gray project.
